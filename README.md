# Restaurant-Tip-Analysis
# 🍽 Restaurant Tip Analysis – EDA Project

This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on a dataset of restaurant tips to uncover patterns and insights related to tipping behavior. The analysis explores how various factors like *bill size, **party size, **day of the week, **gender, and **smoking habits* affect the tip amount.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand the distribution of tip amounts.
- Analyze relationships between *total bill, **tip, and **party size*.
- Investigate how *demographic* and *categorical* factors (e.g., gender, smoker, day) impact tipping.
- Identify any interesting trends or outliers in tipping behavior.

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset used is a cleaned version of the **tips dataset** originally available from the seaborn library. It contains the following columns:

| Column        | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| total_bill  | Total bill amount (in USD)                  |
| tip         | Tip amount (in USD)                         |
| sex         | Gender of the customer                      |
| smoker      | Whether the customer is a smoker            |
| day         | Day of the week                             |
| time        | Time of day (Lunch or Dinner)               |
| size        | Size of the dining party                    |

## 📌 Key Findings

- *Positive correlation* between total bill and tip amount.
- *Larger parties* tend to leave *higher total tips* but *lower tip percentage*.
- *Smokers vs. non-smokers* show differences in tipping behavior.
- *Weekends* generally see higher tips and larger group sizes.
- *Lunch vs. Dinner* tipping patterns vary slightly.
